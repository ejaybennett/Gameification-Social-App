	<h1>Chungus McBiggerson</h1>

	<i>Hello yes this is my bio</i>
	And some pics can be populated here with corresponding buttons
	
	The "Friend Web" button is nice, but we haven't defined a page for it yet on WireFrame so I'm leaving the link out for now.
	I would have assumed this puts us to the find friends page, but the back button already does that, so...
	As a placeholder, this rickrolls you.
